\section{Formulate Statement}

\subsection{ Redefinition of Narrow RevTerminate Principle}
Compared to informal logic proofs, our formal logic proof requires stricter definitions. 
Here is the Narrow RevTerminate Principle:
``Given a reversible abstract machine with a finite number of total states, it will inevitably terminate from any initial state.''

First of all, we define the initial state.  Given a state, if it is not the next state of any other state, we call it an initial state.
\input{ agdaCode/4.1-is-initial }

Secondly, we define the terminate of a reversible machine.
Starting from the initial state $st_{0}$, we use $st_{0}$ $\mapsto$* $st_{n}$ to indicate that $st_{0}$ can reach $st_{n}$ by traversing a finite number of steps.
\input{ agdaCode/4.1-mapsto-star }

If a state $st_{0}$ have no next state, we call it a stuck state.
\input{ agdaCode/4.1-is-stuck }

The termination of a reversible machine means that given an initial state, it will reach a stuck state.
\input{ agdaCode/4.1-terminate }

Finally, we define ``a reversible abstract machine with a finite number of total states.''
Here is the definition of Fin in agda.  A Fin 𝑁 set have exactly 𝑁 elements.
\input{ agdaCode/4.1-Fin }

We construct a bijection between the set of states and Fin 𝑁.
It is as if all states are indexed by an element in the Fin 𝑁 set.
\input{ agdaCode/4.1-finite-total-states }

Combining the definition above, we have the exact definition of Narrow RevTerminate Principle:
\input{ agdaCode/4.1-Narrow-RevTerminate-Principle }

\subsection{ Redefinition of Broad RevTerminate Principle }
Here is the Broad RevTerminate Principle:
``Given a reversible abstract machine, it will inevitably terminate from any initial state with a finite number of reachable states.''

Most of the definitions are the same as those in the Narrow RevTerminate Principle:

For a state to be initial, no other state should have it as their next state.
\input{ agdaCode/4.1-is-initial }

$st_{0}$ $\mapsto$* $st_{n}$ indicates that $st_{0}$ can reach $st_{n}$ by traversing a finite number of steps.
\input{ agdaCode/4.1-mapsto-star }

If a state have no next state, we call it a stuck state.
\input{ agdaCode/4.1-is-stuck }

Before defining ``a finite number of reachable states'', we need to define the ``set of reachable states.''
$st_{0}$ $\mapsto$[m] $st_{m}$ means $st_{0}$ reaches $st_{m}$ exactly after m steps.
For all the m and corresponding $st_{m}$ that satisfy $st_{0}$ $\mapsto$[m] $st_{m}$, this is called ``set of reachable states.''
\input{ agdaCode/4.1-set-of-reachable-states}

In Agda, each element of reachable states set is represented as a tuple. 
\input{ agdaImages/4.1-set-of-reachable-states}

Then, we construct a bijection between the set of reachable states and Fin 𝑁.
\input{ agdaCode/4.1-finite-reachable-states }

This means all reachable states are indexed by an element in Fin 𝑁 set.
\input{ agdaImages/4.1-finite-reachable-states}

Combining the definition above, we have the exact definition of the Broad RevTerminate Principle:
\input{ agdaCode/4.1-Broad-RevTerminate-Principle }
