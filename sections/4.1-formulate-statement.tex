\section{Formulate Statement}

\subsection{ Redefinition of Narrow RevTerminate Principle}
相較於 informal logic proof, we need 更嚴格的定義 for our formal logic proof.
Here is the Narrow RevTerminate Principle:
``Given a reversible abstract machine with a finite number of total states, it will inevitably terminate from any initial state.''

First of all, we define the initial state.  Given a state, if 他不是任何state的next state，we call the state is initial.
\input{ agdaCode/4.1-is-initial }

Secondly, we define the terminate of a reversible machine.
Starting from the initial state $st_{0}$, we use $st_{0}$ $\mapsto$* $st_{n}$ presents $st_{0}$ can reach $st_{n}$ by walk through finite steps.
\input{ agdaCode/4.1-mapsto-star }

And if a state $st_{0}$ have no next state, we call the state is stuck.
\input{ agdaCode/4.1-is-stuck }

The terminate of a reversible machine means ``given an initial state, it will reach a stuck state.''
\input{ agdaCode/4.1-terminate }

At last, we define ``a reversible abstract machine with finite number of total states.''
Here is the definition of Fin in agda.  a Fin N set have exactly N elements.
\input{ agdaCode/4.1-Fin }

We construct a bijection relation between state and Fin N.
It seems like all states are indexed by one of element in Fin N set.
\input{ agdaCode/4.1-finite-total-states }

Combine the definition above, and we have the exact definition of Narrow RevTerminate Principle:
\input{ agdaCode/4.1-Narrow-RevTerminate-Principle }

\subsection{ Redefinition of Broad RevTerminate Principle}
Here is the Broad RevTerminate Principle:
``Given a reversible abstract machine, it will inevitably terminate from any initial state with a finite number of reachable states.''

Most of the definitions are same as Narrow RevTerminate Principle, we have:

Given $st_{0}$.  For all of the states, if their next state is not $st_{0}$, then $st_{0}$ is initial state.
\input{ agdaCode/4.1-is-initial }

$st_{0}$ $\mapsto$* $st_{n}$ presents $st_{0}$ can reach $st_{n}$ by walk through finite steps.
\input{ agdaCode/4.1-mapsto-star }

If a state have no next state, we call the state is stuck.
\input{ agdaCode/4.1-is-stuck }

Before defining ``a finite number of reachable states'', we have to dealt with the ``set of reachable states.''
$st_{0}$ $\mapsto$[m] $st_{m}$ means $st_{0}$ walk exactly m steps and reach $st_{m}$
For all the m and 對應的 $st_{m}$ 滿足 $st_{0}$ $\mapsto$[m] $st_{m}$, it's called ``set of reachable states.''
\input{ agdaCode/4.1-set-of-reachable-states}

In agda, each elements of reachable states set seems like a tuple. 
\input{ agdaImages/4.1-set-of-reachable-states}

Then, we construct a bijection relation between reachable state set and Fin N.
\input{ agdaCode/4.1-finite-reachable-states }

It seems like all reachable states are indexed by one of element in Fin N set.
\input{ agdaImages/4.1-finite-reachable-states}

Combine the definition above, and we have the exact definition of Broad RevTerminate Principle:
\input{ agdaCode/4.1-Broad-RevTerminate-Principle }
