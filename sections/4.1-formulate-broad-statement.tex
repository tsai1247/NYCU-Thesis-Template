\section{ Formulate Statement }
The definition of broad reversible machine shows below:

\input{agdaCode/4.1-broad-revTermination-definition}

It is similar to the narrow one, except for the Bijection.
In the Statement of narrow reversible machine termination, we consider the number of all states is finite.
On the contrary, the Statement of broad reversible machine termination firstly given an $st_{0}$, and 限定了 the number of "reachable states from $st_{0}$" is finite.
In this restriction, the number of states could be infinite.  Some initial states in machine may also not be terminated unless we know the initial state can just reach finite states.
