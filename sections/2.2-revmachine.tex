\section{Reversible Abstract Machine}

The Reversible Abstract Machine, abbreviated as RevMachine, is defined as follows.

\input{agdaCode/2.2-rev-machine-definition}

"State" is the set of all states.

"$\mapsto$" is used to record state transitions, for example, $st_{0}$ $\mapsto$ $st_{1}$ indicates that $st_{0}$ transitions to $st_{1}$.

"Deterministic" refers to forward determinism, meaning that identical states will transition to the same next state.

"deterministicᵣₑᵥ", on the other hand, is the opposite of "deterministic", indicating that for each state, all possible transitions to it are the same.

Based on the definitions above, given a RevMachine and one of its states, we can determine an invariant trace composed of states.
