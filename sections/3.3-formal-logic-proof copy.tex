\section{Informal Logic Proof}

With the steps in informal logic proof, we can construct a Similar proof for the formal one.  However, there are 許多細節需要更詳細的定義.
The 大致上的 steps are shown below:
\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item Starting from initial state, try looking for its next state. 
\item If the next state exists, keep looking for 再下一個 state
\item Upon reaching the n-th state, proof that it's impossible for the existence of next states.
\end{enumerate}.
