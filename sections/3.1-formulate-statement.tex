\section{Formulate Statement}

First of all, letâ€™s define the following terms:
``Initial state'' means a state that no other state can reach in the machine.
``Termination of the machine'' means reaching a state with no subsequent state to transition to. This final state is also called the ``stuck state.''
When we said ``the machine will terminate from an initial state,'' it means that starting from the initial state, through a finite number of transitions, we will reach a stuck state.

We have a reversible abstract machine, and designate one of the state as initial state.  
It's known that there are finite number of reachable states from the initial state.  
Given the forward determinism of the reversible machines, we can assume that the machine will terminate from the initial state.

Here is our complete statement:
``Given a reversible abstract machine, it will inevitably terminate from any initial state with a finite number of reachable states.''
We call this the ``Broad RevTerminate Principle.''

In the statement, the total number of states in the machine may be infinite.
For the informal logic proof, we can easily ignore those unreachable states.  
However, it is relatively difficult for formal proof. 
Therefore, we make a narrower statement as follows:

``Given a reversible abstract machine with a finite number of total states, it will inevitably terminate from any initial state.''
We call this the ``Narrow RevTerminate Principle''.

In the statement, we could say ``we have walked through all the states, so it should terminate.'' in both informal and formal proofs easily.
We will provide a detailed proof in the next section.
