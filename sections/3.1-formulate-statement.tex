\section{Formulate Statement}

First of all, 先定義以下名詞：
``initial state'' means that in the machine, there is no other state reaching it.
``the termination of machine'' means we reach a state in the machine, and there is no next state can be reached.  The last state also be called the ``stuck state''
When we said ``the machine will terminate from an initial state'' means that starting from initial state, 經過machine有限次的推移，we will reach an stuck state.

We have a reversible abstract machine, and 指定 one of the state as initial state.  
It's known that there are finite number of reachable states from initial state.  
With the forward deterministic of reversible machine, we could make the assumption that the initial state will terminate from the initial state.

Here is our 完整的 statement:
``Given a reversible abstract machine, it will inevitably terminate from any initial state with a finite number of reachable states.''
We call it ``Broad RevTerminate Principle''.

In the statement, the number of total state in the machine may be infinite.
For the informal logic proof, we can easily ignore those unreachable states.  However, it's 相對困難 for the formal proof.
Therefore, we make an 較狹義的 statement as below:
``Given a reversible abstract machine, it will inevitably terminate from any initial state with a finite number of total states.''
We call it ``Narrow RevTerminate Principle''.

In the statement, we could say ``we have walked through all the states, so it should be terminate.'' in both informal and formal proof easily.
We will make the 更詳細的證明 in the next section.
