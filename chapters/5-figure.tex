\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{chapter:fig}

In this paper, we have extended the work of Chao-Hong Chen by providing comprehensive formal proofs for the termination of reversible abstract machine.  Our contributions can be summarized as follows:
\begin{enumerate}[1.]
    \item Formalization and Proof Completion: We have successfully formalized and completed the proofs for two theorems that were only partially addressed in the original work. By doing so, we ensured a rigorous validation of the termination conditions for reversible abstract machines.
    \item In the proof above, we initially focused on the scenario where all states are finite.  We then extended this proof to encompass cases with infinite states but with a finite number of reachable states from given initial state, thereby broadening the applicability and robustness of our results.
    \item Implementation in Agda: We provided approximately 400 lines of Agda code to support our theoretical findings. This code serves not only as a proof of concept but also as a practical tool for verifying the correctness of our formal proofs.
\end{enumerate}
