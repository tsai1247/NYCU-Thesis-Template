    In the research conducted by CHAO-HONG CHEN, the interpretation of compact closed categories in terms of "reversing time" and "reversing space" was formalized and applied to the implementation of reversible SAT solvers.
    Among these, the technique for proving termination of reversible abstract machines stands out as particularly important. 
    In this study, two theorems are mentioned regarding termination proofs, but only partial formalization of concepts was utilized.

    Our research delved into this issue specifically. 
    We proposed a hypothesis: for reversible abstract machines, if the reachable states from a given initial state are finite, then the initial state will terminate within a finite number of steps through transitions of the reversible abstract machine. 
    We first presented a narrow proof based on this hypothesis, with the restriction that "the total number of states of the reversible abstract machine is finite." 
    Subsequently, we removed this restriction and completed a more generalized proof.
